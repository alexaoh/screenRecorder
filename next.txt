Use the Microsoft Mail API to get the correct url to zoom-lecture
from my Outlook Email: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started

Play with these commands: http://terokarvinen.com/2015/volume-control-with-pulseaudio-command-line-tools
--> To make sure that the audio is unmuted and the headphone output device is selected. 

Could maybe use zoom-webhooks to start recording when the meeting is started, 
and stop recording when the meeting has ended!? Link: 
https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/webhook-reference/meeting-events/meeting-started
(Should stop the recording when the "meeting has ended pop-up shows in the browser!)

MEN, KOMMER TIL EN CAPTCHA STRAKS DEN ÅPNES MED SELENIUM! MÅ DERMED FINNE EN LØSNING PÅ DETTE!?!?
Need to get past zoom's captcha!

Could avoid zoom altogether by opening as: firefox (url), but how to interact with the page then?
(console with JavaScript?) It should be enough to just use requests and get/post requests!

Test first if it is possible to trick the server to thinking the script is human: (avoid triggering the reCAPTCHA)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58872451/how-to-bypass-google-captcha-with-selenium-and-python
The link also contains a suggestion about saving cookies after solving the reCAPTCHA manually. 

Try the 'Buster'-extension for solving the reCAPTCHA:

https://addons.mozilla.org/nb-NO/firefox/addon/buster-captcha-solver/
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-easily-bypass-recaptchav2-with-selenium-7f7a9a44fa9e

Could use 2captcha. DeathByCaptcha . etc. Seems pretty easy to just find a fitting service (if the tips above don't work)

Write a guide on how to find the Firefox extension PATH in README also (among other documentation).
