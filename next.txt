How to force Zoom Meeting on web browser and block Open Zoom app dialog:

--> This uses a Chrome-extension! Try to download the Chrome webdriver instead, and
add the extension needed to force zoom to open in browser! (Try before Thursday!)

Could maybe use zoom-webhooks to start recording when the meeting is started, 
and stop recording when the meeting has ended!? Link: 
https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/webhook-reference/meeting-events/meeting-started
(Should stop the recording when the "meeting has ended pop-up shows in the browser!)


Zoom:
name input xpath: //*[@id="inputname"]
The checkbox xpath: /html/body/div[2]/div[3]/div[1]/div/div/span/div[1]
button xpath: //*[@id="joinBtn"]

Join by computer audio button: /html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div[3]/div/div[2]/div/button 

zoom chat button xpath: /html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div/div[2]/footer/div/div[2]/button[3]/div/div (turn on chat on the right side of the screen)

MEN, KOMMER TIL EN CAPTCHA STRAKS DEN ÅPNES MED SELENIUM! MÅ DERMED FINNE EN LØSNING PÅ DETTE!?!?
Need to get past zoom's captcha!

Could avoid zoom altogether by opening as: firefox (url), but how to interact with the page then?
(console with JavaScript?) It should be enough to just use requests and get/post requests!
